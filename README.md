This project focuses on the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of environmental datasets for latin america and caribbean, including waste management and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data. The repository contains:
1- Data Cleaning Script: A Python notebook (Cleaning Script.ipynb) that processes and cleans raw datasets for analysis.
2- Processed Datasets: Cleaned versions of the waste management (01Cleaned_data.xlsx) and GHG data (02 Cleaned_GHG.xlsx).
3- Visualization Dashboard: A Tableau workbook (Dashboard.twbx) for interactive data exploration and insights.
4- Original Data: Raw data sources (Data Source _ Before Cleaning.xlsx) used as the input for the cleaning script.
